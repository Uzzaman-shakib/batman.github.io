		 <h2>CREATION OF BATMAN</h2>
		 
		 <p>In early 1939, the success of Superman in Action Comics prompted editors at National Comics Publications (the future DC Comics) to requestmore superheroes for its titles. In response, Bob Kane created "the Bat-Man". Collaborator Bill Finger recalled that "Kane had an idea fora character called 'Batman,' and he'd like me to see the drawings. I went over to Kane's, and he had drawn a character who looked very much likeSuperman with kind of ... reddish tights, I believe, with boots ... no gloves, no gauntlets ... with a small domino mask, swinging on a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it was a big sign ... BATMAN". The bat-wing-like cape was suggested by Bob Kane, inspired by Leonardo Da Vinci's sketch of an ornithopter flying device as a child.</p>
